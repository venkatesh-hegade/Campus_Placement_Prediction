# Objective 🎯
The goal of this project is to analyse the campus placement prediction, based on a combination of features that describes whether he/she may get placed in companies.

# Problem Statement ❓
The Placement of students is one of the most important objective of an educational institution. Reputation and yearly admissions of an institution invariably depend on the placements it provides it students with. That is why all the institutions, arduously, strive to strengthen their placement department so as to improve their institution on a whole. Any assistance in this particular area will have a positive impact on an institution’s ability to place its students. This will always be helpful to both the students, as well as the institution.
The main goal is to predict whether the student will be recruited in campus placements or not based on the available factors in the dataset.
